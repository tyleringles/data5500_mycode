#Deleting a node from a Binary Search Tree (BST) is kind of like removing something from a sorted list, but you have to keep the tree in order. First, you find the node you want to delete by checking if it's smaller or bigger than the current node and moving left or right until you find it. Once you find it, there are three main cases. If the node has no children, you can just remove it. If it has one child, you replace it with that child so the tree still connects properly. If the node has two children, it gets trickier—you find the smallest value in the right side of the tree (called the in-order successor), copy that value into the node you’re deleting, and then delete the copy of that value from the right side. That way, everything stays in the right order. One thing to watch out for is if the node you're deleting is the root of the tree, because you have to make sure the new root is set correctly. Also, if there are duplicates in the tree, you need a rule for where they go, like always putting them on the right. This method doesn’t keep the tree perfectly balanced, so if you delete a lot of stuff, it might get lopsided and slower to search. But overall, it works well for basic tree operations.
